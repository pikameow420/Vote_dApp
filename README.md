# vote_dApp

This project is created using React and Moralis.

Smart contracts of this project are written in Solidity and deployed on the polygon_mumbai testnet.

Currently this project is depraced as it was using Moralis v1, and most of the frontend has become redundant.
 
Will soon migrate it to Morals v2.



Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
